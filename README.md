Text Decoder

verview
The "Text Decoder" is a simple web application that encodes and decodes text using specific transformations for each vowel. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to input text, encode or decode it based on predefined rules, and copy the result to the clipboard.

Features
- Text Encoding: Converts vowels into coded strings:
  - `e` -> `enter`
  - `i` -> `imes`
  - `a` -> `ai`
  - `o` -> `ober`
  - `u` -> `ufat`
- Text Decoding: Reverts the coded strings back to the original vowels.
- Copy to Clipboard: Allows users to easily copy the encoded/decoded text.

How It Works
1. Input Text: Enter the text you want to encode or decode into the input field.
2. Select Action: Choose to either encode or decode the text.
3. View Output: The result is displayed in the output field.
4. Copy Result: Use the "Copy" button to copy the output text to your clipboard.

Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the application. No additional setup is required.

File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the text encoding and decoding logic.
